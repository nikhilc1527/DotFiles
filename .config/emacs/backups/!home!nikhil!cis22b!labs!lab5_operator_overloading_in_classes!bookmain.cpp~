PSEUDOCODE:
create input file stream from input file, whose name is known always
create an array of books, in which books will be stored
loop for each of the books
create an array of 8 strings to represent the 8 data fields that each book will have
read in the next 8 lines to each of the strings in the array of strings
initialize the book with the 8 strings, passing all 8 to the constructor of the book
after books are created:
loop for each of the books again
for each book, print out all 8 books, using the getter methods to get the information from each book
