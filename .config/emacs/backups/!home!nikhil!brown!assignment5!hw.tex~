\section{Explain the difference between classical and quantum physics (1 to 2 paragraphs).}

The main difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that classical mechanics deals with relatively large objects, that humans deal
with in everyday life, and where the uncertainty of these objects is very small compared to the mass and energy, while quantum mechanics
deals with extremely small particles, on the subatomic scale, where the uncertainty is very large compared to the particles. On the large
scale, there is very little uncertainty regarding where the object is, because the object is so massive and contains so many atoms, and
therefore the classical equations, like Newton's laws of motion, apply and are precise enough that we cannot perceive the uncertainty.
However, on the quantum scale, everything is in a state of uncertainty, because the very act of perceiving can change the state of the
particle.

\section{Explain why the beta decay energy distribution suggested the existence of neutrinos (1 paragraph).}

In the process of beta decay, neutrons or protons are in higher energy levels than the other, while there is also an spot energy vacant in a
lower energy level, prompting one to turn into the other. Since the charge is not conserved during this process, an extra electron must be
ejected, with a very high kinetic energy, to conserve the total energy of the system. The kinetic energy of this ejected electron could be
theoretically calculated, because the mass and energies of protons and neutrons are fixed, and in order for the mass/energy to be conserved,
the ejected electron must also have a fixed kinetic energy level. However, this was experimentally disproven, because the ejected electrons
were seen to have kinetic energy levels following a probability distribution, rather than only one fixed point, and with the kinetic energies
of the electrons being anywhere betweeen 0 and the maximum possible (expected value). Since the very fundamental laws of conservation
of momentum and energy were being violated by this process, some other explanation was needed to make this process conform to the laws
of conservation of energy and momentum. The neutrino was the magic particle that would solve this, because if there was another particle
that is part of this reaction
