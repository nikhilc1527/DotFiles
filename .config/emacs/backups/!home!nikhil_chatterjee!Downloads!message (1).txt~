Mobilization of the American Army required cooperation between the federal government and corporations that manufacture arms, which led to the creation of many federal agencies. These agencies include the Production Board, which was responsible for converting factories and plants to military use, the National War Labor Board, which settled labor disputes through mediation and arbitration, the Office of Price Administration, which set the price ceilings on items and controlled inflation, and the Office of Censorship, which censored all communicaions between the United States and other nations to prevent leakage of important military information. WWII also provided lasting social and economic gains for women, because they were needed for industrial work to support the military while a considerable amount of men were in the army. The experienced the women gained in industrial work laid the groundwork for a women's movement in later years, making the war a step on the road to equal rights. African Americans also benefitted from the war, because they fought for less discrimination in the army and black airmen and soldiers gained more rights. These efforts to allow African American GIs more rights resemble the protests of the Civil Rights Movement, which occured after the war, which shows that the efforts made in the war allowed the Civil Rights Movement to be more successful. WWII returned prosperity after the depression in the 1930s and promoted growth of big business and the military. It also strengthened the power of the federal government, and especially the President, over state and local governments. However, the prosperity as a result of the war kept the Ameircan Dream the same. People didn't want a new and improved future for America, but instead wanted to relive the 1920s and the self-confidence they had prior to the depression. The war didn't alter the American Dream, but it did make America more involved in global politics, a stark contrast to its past isolationist policies.
