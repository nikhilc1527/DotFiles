\section{}

The weak force is one of the 4 fundamental forces in the
universe, and is the force responsible for decay,
specifically beta decay, which is the process in which a
neutron decays into a proton, electron, and
anti-neutrino. The weak force is an attractive force, but
only acts at very short distances, even 10\% of the diameter
of a proton. The force carriers for this force are the W and
Z bosons. The W boson can be charged, and in turn changes
the charge of other particles it comes into contact
with. The weak force can change the flavor of a quark by
emitting charged W bosons. The function of a Z boson is
harder to detect, but experiments relating to the Z boson
did result in the theory of unification of the weak and
electromagnetic forces, into the electroweak force.

\section{}

The strong force is one of the four fundamental forces that
holds the nucleus of an atom together. Without the strong
force, the electromagnetic forces of the nucleus would
immediately cause any atom to cease to exist, but the strong
force is what allows the neutrons and protons to be held
together. Specifically, the strong force holds together the
quarks inside of the neutrons and protons: the two down and
one up quarks of a neutron, and two up and one down quarks
of a proton.

The strong force is unique from the other forces in that it
is not indirectly proportional to the distance between two
particles that it is acting on: the magnitude of the force
gets to 0 with very small distances, although it is similar
to gravity because it is always attractive. This allows the
strong force and the electromagnetic forces to come into a
balancing point to hold together the protons and neutrons:
the strong force attracting, and the electromagnetic force
repelling. The strong force is also unique in that there are
3 different types of interactions that it can have with
particles, with 3 different types of ``charges'' for the
strong force. A particle is only balanced under the strong
force if there are an equal number of each strong force
charged quarks in that particle, which is why protons and
neutrons must have 3 quarks each.

\section{}

The quark theory was so difficult to accept for the
physicists of the time because they were proposed to have a
fractional charge: either $\minus\frac{1}{3}$ the charge of
an electron or $\frac{2}{3}$ of the charge of an
electron. This had never been thought of before, and seemed
very weird to be a plausible idea. Furthermore, there was
very little experimental evidence to their existence, so the
physicists had no real reason to accept them until the deep
inelastic scattering experiment in the SLAC.

\section{}

In this experiment, many very highly charged electrons were
bombarded against protons, to see what would happen. These
electrons were charged on the scale of up to 20GeV, or 20
billion electron volts. At first, the electrons were
bouncing off elastically, meaning that there was no breaking
of the protons. This implied that there was no core to
protons, and that they were indeed fundamental particles,
which went against the theory of quarks, and made the quark
theory even harder to believe and accept.

However, in the next experiment performed by the
collaboration between MIT and SLAC, the electrons were
rebounding with much less energy than they were going in
with, meaning that the energy must have been used somewhere
in the collision with the protons. This meant that the
protons did indeed break up, and that there was a core to
the protons that was not observed before. The electrons were
also bouncing off at an angle, so this could not be
attributed to decay. This experiment was very similar to the
experiment in which Rutherford discovered the atomic
nucleus, where he bombarded alpha particles against atoms,
and since they were bouncing off at an angle, they must have
been hitting a hard core inside of the atoms.
