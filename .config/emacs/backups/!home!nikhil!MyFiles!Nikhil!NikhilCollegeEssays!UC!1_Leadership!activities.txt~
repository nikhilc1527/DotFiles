Activity 4: Personal coaching project (java)

Dates: 6/20-9/30

Description: I created my own nonprofit called Chatterjee Tutoring, for which I advertised that I would be teaching a beginner java course to whoever registered. Ten people registered, the most notable of them being a man in his 40s. He explained how his job was very unstable due to covid, and I could help him to attain a much more stable and comfortable job by teaching him programming (have email for reference). While teaching him and the other students, I learned the valuable skills of always preparing the entire lessons ahead of time, and having to fully understand the material before being able to properly teach the concept. After teaching, he told me that I had indeed helped him to attain a job in programming, and through my engaging teaching, he had been inspired to read and learn more about programming.

Activity 14: Helping my gardener

Dates: 2/21

Description: 
When my gardener had his van stolen from him, along with all of his tools and equipment, I felt very bad for him because he didn’t have legal status, didn’t know english. In order to help him, I started a gofundme campaign, along with my father for the monetary transactions, in order to raise money for him to buy a new vehicle and gardening equipment. In order to drive the gofundme campaign, I passed out flyers in my neighborhood, posted advertisements on the neighborhood website, and contacted many of my friends and relatives who could help. Finally, we were able to raise the goal amount of money, and buy him a new van and equipment. Furthermore, while looking for a suitable van, I used my knowledge of the spanish language that I had picked up in school in order to translate between the gardener and the various sellers, and make the transaction more seamless


Activity 16: Assistant coach for Regnart elementary school basketball team, helping Gadepally(4th grade students)

Dates: 6th-9th grade

Description: In order to maintain a good relationship with my old teachers, I joined them each week to help them out in the classroom whenever I did not have class and they did. I helped out my 3rd grade teacher, Mrs. Gadepally, in her classroom, teaching the concepts to the students who were behind in learning, as well as other tasks around the class. I also developed a friendship with my 4th grade teacher, Mr. Stendahl, and joined him as an assistant coach to the Regnart basketball team. I did such a good job that one time he put his full trust in me to step in for him as the head coach of the team, and I succeeded in leading the team and calling the correct plays against the opponent.
