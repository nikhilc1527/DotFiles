\section{}

The main difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that classical mechanics deals with
relatively large objects, that humans deal with in everyday life, and where the uncertainty of these
objects is very small compared to the mass and energy, while quantum mechanics deals with extremely
small particles, on the subatomic scale, where the uncertainty is very large compared to the
particles. On the large scale, there is very little uncertainty regarding where the object is,
because the object is so massive and contains so many atoms, and therefore the classical equations,
like Newton's laws of motion, apply and are precise enough that we cannot perceive the uncertainty.
However, on the quantum scale, everything is in a state of uncertainty, because the very act of
perceiving can change the state of the particle.

\section{}

In the process of beta decay, neutrons or protons are in higher energy levels than the other, while
there is also an spot energy vacant in a lower energy level, prompting one to turn into the
other. Since the charge is not conserved during this process, an extra electron must be ejected,
with a very high kinetic energy, to conserve the total energy of the system. The kinetic energy of
this ejected electron could be theoretically calculated, because the mass and energies of protons
and neutrons are fixed, and in order for the mass/energy to be conserved, the ejected electron must
also have a fixed kinetic energy level. However, this was experimentally disproved, because the
ejected electrons were seen to have kinetic energy levels following a probability distribution,
rather than only one fixed point, and with the kinetic energies of the electrons being anywhere
tween 0 and the maximum possible (expected value). Since the very fundamental laws of conservation
of momentum and energy were being violated by this process, some other explanation was needed to
make this process conform to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. The neutrino was the
magic particle that would solve this, because if there was another particle that is part of this
reaction, it would be the one to take all of the excess energy, momentum, and spin of the system,
therefore restoring the conservation of energy, momentum, and spin to the reaction.

\section{}

The motivation for the experiment was that the theory of a neutrino was sitting unproven for 30
years, and was haunting the minds of the physicists who could not prove the existence of the
neutrino. Finally, in 1956, Cowan and Reines came up with the experiment that would prove the
neutrino's existence.

In order to come up with the experiment, they had to realize the basis for where the idea of the
neutrino was born: the beta decay process. In this process, an extra neutron, which has more energy
than the protons in the highest energy level, and there is a vacant spot in the protons highest
energy level, will be very unstable, and want to move down. Therefore, the neutron must convert into
a proton, and in the process an electron will be ejected to satisfy the conservation of charge, as
well as a neutrino to satisfy the conversation of energy, momentum, and spin. Since the neutrinos
are very small, and have an extremely weak interaction with other matter, it was very hard to prove
their existence. In order to prove it, Cowan and Reines took the opposite reaction: they bombarded
protons into neutrinos, which yielded a neutron as well as an anti-electron, or positron. If they
could just detect this reaction, then the existence of the neutrino would be proven, since there is
no other way that a proton by itself can yield neutrons and positrons. In order to set up the
experiment, Cowan and Reines found a nuclear reactor, where the flux of neutrinos is very high, and
where they could easily get results from bombarding the protons against neutrinos. They also had two
tanks: one with a large amount of cadmium chloride ($Cd Cl_2$) in order to supply protons, and
another with large amounts of LSD, to capture the neutrons. There were two reactions that were
observed: one was that the neutron was captured in the cadmium LSD, in a neutron capture reaction,
which resulted in two gamma rays that could be detected, and the other was that the positron that is
ejected will come together with a electron, and they will annihilate each other, releasing three
gamma rays that can also be detected. The end result of the experiment was that both of these
reactions were detected, therefore proving that neutrinos do exist.
